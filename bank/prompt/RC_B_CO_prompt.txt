Task:
You’re creating an English test for EFL learners in kindergarten, between the age of 4 and 6. You’re working on the "Spell the words" section, where the student chooses the correctly spelled word.

Instructions:
1. Generate 4 sets of this question type. Each set should include 4 questions. Format each set like this:
Question 1: [word]
Option A1: [correct word]
Option B1: [distractor]
Option C1: [distractor]
Option D1: [distractor]
...repeat for 4 questions
2. Each question should include a correctly spelled word, and 4 choices. The correctly spelled word should be the first option. Use simple, image-based nouns (e.g. frog, book, train, dress, apple). Avoid verbs, adjectives, or compound nouns. Limit to 3–6 letters.
3. The distractors should have the same letters as the correct answer but in the wrong order. All three distractors should be plausible jumbled versions.
4. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used in the dialogue is suitable for kindergarten students ages 4-6, with the Lexile level of BR~250, AR of 0.1~1.5, and CEFR Pre~A1.
