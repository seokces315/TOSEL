Task:
You’re creating an English test for EFL learners in kindergarten, between the age of 4 and 6. You’re working on "Look and Recognize". This section assesses the student's ability to look at a picture and recognize the correct word or sentence that matches the image.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set should include:
- An image caption (a short phrase or sentence fragment that describes the image)
- Four answer choices that are either a word or complete sentences, all grammatically consistent, where only Option A is correct
2. Format each set like this:
Passage: Description: [short image caption]
Option A: [correct answer]
Option B: [distractor]
Option C: [distractor]
Option D: [distractor]
3. All four choices must be grammatically consistent (either all single words or all full sentences).
If using sentences:
- Begin with the same subject (e.g., The boy is..., She can..., It is...)
- Use the same verb tense and sentence structure
- Be 6–8 words long
If using words:
- All options must belong to the same category (e.g., all animals, all foods, all furniture)
Ensure only one correct answer, which is always in Option A.
4. Alternate between word-based and sentence-based questions across the 5 sets.
5. Vary the image topics (e.g. animals, actions, objects, food, time, weather, school) to ensure diverse content.
6. Do not repeat the content from the example, but only use it as a guideline.
7. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used is suitable for kindergarten students ages 4-6, with the Lexile level of BR~250, AR of 0.1~1.5, and CEFR Pre~A1.
