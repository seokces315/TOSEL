Task:
You're working on the "Sentence Completion" section. The purpose of this section is to assess middle school students’ understanding of English grammar in everyday conversations. Students must read a short dialogue and choose the correct word or phrase that completes the blank naturally and grammatically.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set should include a short everyday dialogue between A and B, one blank in the dialogue, four answer choices (A–D) for the blank.
2. For the two-person dialogue (A and B), one of the lines should contain a blank, and the student selects the correct word to complete it. Keep the context everyday and age-appropriate (e.g., school life, hobbies, meals, feelings, etc.) Sentences in the dialogue should be natural-sounding, short (no more than 12 words per speaker), and can be statements, questions, or exclamations.
3. The blank should test one grammar concept, chosen from the list below. Each set must test a different concept. Choose from:
- nouns and pronouns
- subject-Verb agreement
- verb tenses
- passive and active voice
- modal verbs
- wh-questions (interrogatives)
- adjectives and adverbs
- comparatives and superlatives
- prepositions and conjunctions
- infinitives and gerunds
- relative pronouns and relative adverbs
5. For the answer choices:
- Include only one correct answer (Option A)
- Make Options B, C, D either grammatically incorrect or clearly wrong in context
- Keep all choices plausible in appearance, so that students must apply grammar knowledge
7. Ensure the level of the vocabulary and the difficulty of the questions are suitable for middle school students in grade 7-8 with Lexile 800-1100, AR of 5.5~8.0, and CEFR B2+~C1.
