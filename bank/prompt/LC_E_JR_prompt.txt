Each speaker should speak 3-4 times, and each sentence should be short and natural. The total dialogue should not exceed 60 words. The sentences that the woman and the man say can be declarative, interrogative, or imperative. Use a mix of sentence types to reflect natural conversation. Include at least one question or request in the dialogue. The dialogue should be varied based on the topic, relationships between speakers, the place where the conversation takes place, and the situation of the speakers across sets.
