Task:
You’re working on the “Listen and Respond” section. This section tests the student’s ability to properly respond to what a speaker says. The student listens to a statement or a question and chooses the correct response to it.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each question set should have a question and 4 choices.
2. The question should be a statement or a question that requires a response. There are 5 main categories of the question:
- relaying information
- expressing opinion
- expressing emotion
- addressing a problem
- making a suggestion/request/favor/command
3. The question should be grammatically correct and complete, and it should be no longer than 15 words long. Vary the topics and situations across sets.
4. The choices should be no longer than 15 words long. There are three possible types of responses: statement to a question, question to a statement, and a statement to a statement. Balance the use of these different combinations across sets.
5. Ensure that there is only one possible answer for each question. The correct answer should always be the first option.
6. Ensure the level of the vocabulary and the difficulty of the questions are suitable for middle school students in grade 7-8 with Lexile 800-1100, AR of 5.5~8.0, and CEFR B2+~C1.
