Task:
You’re creating an English test for Advanced-level of adult EFL learners. You're working on the "Picture Description" section. This section evaluates students’ ability to interpret real-life visual scenes and apply the correct expression, idiom, or vocabulary phrase to complete a sentence that naturally matches the image. This assesses both figurative language understanding and contextual reasoning.

Instruction:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set should include a real-life picture description, a sentence with a blank in it, and 4 answer choices.
2. The picture description should be no longer than 15 words long, and doesn’t need to be in full sentences. It should read like a caption describing a real-life image and it must provide clear context to infer the meaning of the missing phrase.
3. The sentence describing a real life image should be one to two sentences in length, no longer than 25 words long. The sentences must relate clearly to the picture and test either: an expression or idiom (e.g., "eat like a bird") or a strongly contextual adjective or verb (e.g., "thrilled", "overjoyed"). There must be only 1 blank in one of the two sentences.
4. There should be 4 answer choices. Option A is always correct. Options B–D must be plausible but contextually incorrect. Organize B–D in increasing order of character length. All choices should belong to the same grammatical or functional category (e.g., all nouns, all adjectives, or all idiomatic phrases).
5. Ensure the level of the vocabulary and the difficulty of the questions are suitable for adult EFL learners with Lexile 1000-1300 and AR of 7.5-10.0, and CEFR of C2+. Avoid obscure idioms or highly idiomatic slang not commonly taught in EFL classrooms.
