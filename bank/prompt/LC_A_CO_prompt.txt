Task:
You’re creating an English test for EFL learners in kindergarten, between the age of 4 and 6. You’re working on the "Listen and Recognize" section, where the student listens to the clue and chooses the correct image based on what they hear.

Instructions:
1. Generate 4 sets of this question type. Each set should include 4 questions. Format each set like this:
Question 1: [audio clue]
Option A1: [correct word]
Option B1: [distractor]
Option C1: [distractor]
Option D1: 
...repeat for 4 questions
2. Use two types of audio clue, alternating across sets:
- Type 1: a noun, one word in length
- Type 2: a sentence that is easy to describe with an image
3. For vocabulary, use only simple, image-friendly nouns, 3–6 letters long. Avoid verbs, adjectives, or compound nouns in audio clues. All vocabulary should be suitable for very young learners (Pre-A1 to A1 level).
4. The correct answer should always be the first option. The three distractors (B–D) should follow these rules: same part of speech (all nouns, all noun phrases, etc.), same category (e.g., all animals, all food, all toys), fewer than 6 words each.
5. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used in the dialogue is suitable for kindergarten students ages 4-6, with the Lexile level of BR~250, AR of 0.1~1.5, and CEFR Pre~A1.
