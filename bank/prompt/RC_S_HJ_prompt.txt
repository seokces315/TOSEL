Task:
You’re creating an English test for High Junior level EFL learners in high school. You're working on the "General Reading and Retelling" section. In this section, the student reads a nonfiction passage and then completes a concise summary of that passage that contains two blanks.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set should include a reading passage, a summary of the passage with 2 blanks in it, 2 multiple questions, with 4 answer choices for each question.
2. The reading material should be no more than 130 words long, about a topic from areas such as science, history, psychology, art, or literature. Use a different topic for each set.
3. The summary of the passage (maximum 70 words), should be accurately paraphrased, containing exactly two blanks labeled [A] and [B].
4. There should be two multiple-choice questions, each asking the student to choose the correct word for one blank. Each question should include 4 answer choices (A–D) from the same part of speech. Option A must always be the correct answer.
5. The choices for each blank must be grammatically correct in the sentence, but only Option A should make full contextual sense. Avoid using words from the passage verbatim in the summary.
6. Do not repeat words in options and ensure all incorrect options are plausible but clearly wrong based on the passage.
7. Ensure vocabulary and passage complexity is appropriate for high school students in grades 9–12 (Lexile 1000–1300, AR level 7.5–10.0, CEFR of C1+~C2).
