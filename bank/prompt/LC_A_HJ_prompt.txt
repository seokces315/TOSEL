Task:
You’re creating an English test for High Junior level EFL learners in high school. You’re working on the Listen and Recognize section. This section tests the student’s ability to properly recognize an image through a dialogue. The student will listen to a dialogue and choose the correct picture that corresponds to it.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type.  Each question set involves a short dialogue (alternating: Man speaks once, Woman speaks once), a question prompt, and 4 image captions (answer options), with only Option A being correct.
2. The dialogue should be between a man and a woman. The man and the woman should each speak once, alternating. The topics of the dialogue can be about actions of people, description of people, or description of objects. Vary the topics, relationships between speakers, and grammatical structures across sets. Each line in the dialogue should be no longer than 12 words long.
3. There should be 4 image captions as answer choices. The options should be plausible as image descriptions. Only Option A should be the correct match to the dialogue. All 4 options must:
- Be grammatically consistent (e.g., all noun phrases, all verbs, all adjectives, etc.)
- Have the same subject
4. The dialogue, question and answer choices should be varied across sets, using different grammatical structures and vocabulary, as well as not overlapping in topic. Use rich vocabulary appropriate for adult learners. Ensure only one clearly correct answer per question.
5. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used is suitable for high school students in grade 9-12 with Lexile 1000-1300, AR of 7.5-10.0, and CEFR C1+~C2.
