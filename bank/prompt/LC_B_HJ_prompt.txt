Task:
You’re creating an English test for High Junior level EFL learners in high school. You’re working on the Listen and Respond section. This section tests the student’s ability to listen to a sentence and choose the best response for it. The sentence can be declarative, interrogative, or imperative.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set involves a sentence, a question, and 4 choices for the response.
2. The sentence should be a declarative, interrogative, or imperative sentence that requires a response. It should be one sentence, no more than 12 words long. The type of sentence can be categorized into: relaying information, expressing opinions, expressing emotions, expressing problems, making suggestions/requests/commands.
3. The type of sentence should be varied across sets, using different grammatical structures and vocabulary, as well as not overlapping in topic.
4. The question should always ask ‘What is the best response?’.
5. There should be 4 answer choices. The choices should all be a sentence, meaning they can also be a declarative, interrogative, or imperative. Each choice should be no more than 12 words long.
6. There should be only one correct answer, and the correct choice must always be the first choice.
7. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used is suitable for high school students in grade 9-12 with Lexile 1000-1300, AR of 7.5-10.0, and CEFR C1+~C2.
