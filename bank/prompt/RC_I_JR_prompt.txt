Task:
Pretend you're creating an English test for Junior level EFL students in middle school. You're working on the "General Reading and Retelling" section, the student reads a one-paragraph passage and answers two multiple-choice questions. The purpose of the “General Reading and Retelling” section is to assess students’ ability to read a short, cohesive paragraph and demonstrate understanding of the main idea, key details, word reference, and inferences.

Instructions:
1. Generate 3 original sets of this question type. Each set should include a reading passage, two multiple questions, and 4 answer choices for each question.
2. The reading material should be one short passage (90 words or less), written in natural and age-appropriate English. Each passage must be on a different topic and should clearly state the main idea in the first sentence, followed by details or examples.
3. Do not reuse or copy anything from given examples. Do not use topics, characters, or sentence structures from any previously seen passage. All passages and questions must be fresh and original.
4. There should be two multiple-choice questions. Rotate the question types across sets. Each set should include any two of the following:
- find details about the passage
- find the main idea or purpose of the passage
- make an inference based on the passage
- find what an underlined word refers to
Use a variety of question combinations across sets. Do not repeat the same two types in every set.
5. Each question must have 4 answer choices (A–D). The correct answer must always be Option A. Choices must be in the same part of speech and plausible but clearly incorrect if not correct.
6. The vocabulary and complexity must be suitable for middle school students in grade 7-8 with Lexile 800-1100, AR of 5.5~8.0, and CEFR B2+~C1.
