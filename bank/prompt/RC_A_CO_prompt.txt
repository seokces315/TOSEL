Task:
You’re creating an English test for EFL learners in kindergarten, between the age of 4 and 6. You’re working on the "Spell the words" section, where the student looks at an image and chooses the letter to spell a word correctly.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 sets of this question type. Each set should include 4 questions. Format each set like this:
Question 1: [word with blank]
Option A1: [correct letter]
Option B1: [distractor]
Option C1: [distractor]
Option D1: [distractor]
...repeat for 4 questions
2. Each question should include a word with a blank in it, and 4 choices. The correct letter that goes in the blank should be the first option. The word should be a noun which is easy to be shown with an image.
3. All distractor letters should be lowercase alphabet letters. They should be plausible phonetic alternatives, not random or unrelated letters. Avoid numbers or uppercase letters.
4. The four options should each be an alphabet letter and there should be only 1 letter that goes in the blank to complete the word.
5. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used in the dialogue is suitable for kindergarten students ages 4-6, with the Lexile level of BR~250, AR of 0.1~1.5, and CEFR Pre~A1.
