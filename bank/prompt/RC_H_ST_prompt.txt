Task:
You're working on the "Practical Reading and Retelling" section, where the student reads practical material and answers two multiple-choice questions about it. This section evaluates the student’s ability to read short, real-world texts and answer detail-based multiple-choice questions about them.

Instructions:
1. Generate 3 sets of this question type. Each set should include a reading material in text form, 2 comprehension questions about it, and 4 answer choices for each question.
2. Reading Material must be no more than 40 words. Each of the 3 sets must use a different type from the following list: invitation, menu, itinerary, notice, announcement, instruction, direction, course schedule.
3. Use clear and age-appropriate language for students in grades 3–4, with a reading level of Lexile 400–650 and AR 2.5–4.5. Keep content simple, visual, and age-appropriate for Lexile 400–650 / AR 2.5–4.5 readers.
4. There should be two Comprehension Questions. Each question must be directly answerable from details in the reading material. Do not require inference or background knowledge beyond what's given.
5. There should be exactly 4 choices per question. The correct answer is always Option A. Other options (B–D) should be plausible but incorrect based on the passage.
6. Ensure the level of the vocabulary and the difficulty of the questions are suitable for elementary students in grade 3-4 with CEFR A2+~B1, Lexile 400-650 and AR of 2.5-4.5.
