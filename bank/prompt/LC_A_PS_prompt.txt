Task:
You’re creating an English test for Pre-starter-level EFL learners in grades 1 and 2. You’re working on the "Listen and Recognize" section, where the student listens to the clue and chooses the correct image that is being described.

Instructions:
1. Generate 5 unique sets of this question type. Each set should include one passage about audio clue and 4 image captions.
2. The audio clue must:
- Use present tense and simple structures.
- Clue should point clearly to only one image (Option A).
- Clues may describe actions, people, animals, places, weather, or colors.
- Be no longer than 6 words long.
3. Image caption guidelines:
- Keep under 10 words.
- All four captions should refer to the same general subject type (e.g., all animals, or all people).
- Only Option A is correct. Options B–D must be realistic, confusing distractors, and not obviously wrong.
- Use variation in noun, verb, adjective, or preposition.
4. Do not repeat or reuse any part of the example.
5. The question and choices should be varied across sets, using different grammatical structures and vocabulary, as well as not overlapping in topic.
6. Ensure the level of the vocabulary used is suitable for elementary students in grade 1-2 with the Lexile level of 200-450, AR of 1.5-3.0, and CEFR A1+~A2.
