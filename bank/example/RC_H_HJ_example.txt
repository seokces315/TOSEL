1. Passage: Reviews: Jane Kim: I’m so glad I bought this sofa during the end-of-year sale. I was able to get it 30% off! I wouldn’t have been satisfied with the original price, but with the “discount” I’m completely happy. It’s the perfect size for my family. The thing I love most about it is that the fabric is waterproof. If my children spill something, I can wipe it right off. Daniel Choi: The sofa was a bit expensive because I bought it at its original price. However, I’m actually quite happy with it. It’s a big-sized sofa, which is what I was looking for. The product also includes a soft cushion. It’s so cozy that my children always fight over it.
