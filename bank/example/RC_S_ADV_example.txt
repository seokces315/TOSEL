Passage: Hailing from the village of Shpotivka (present-day Ukraine), the man known as the father of modern engineering mechanics, Stepen (later Stephen) Timoshenko, was a brilliant applied mechanical engineer who devoted his life to researching and transmitting ideas on structural and mechanical engineering. He worked as a researcher and teaching professor in various universities around the world, including ones in St. Petersburg, Gottingen, Kiev, Zagreb, and numerous institutions in the U.S., culminating with his professorship at Stanford. He pioneered research in elastic calculations and in buckling, an area of mechanics related to compressive stress. Timoshenko was a prolific author of engineering texts aimed at students from first-year undergraduates to advanced practitioners, and textbooks such as Strength of Materials, which was originally published in 1930, are still widely used to teach the next generation of modern engineers.
