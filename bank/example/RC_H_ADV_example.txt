1. Passage: Text messages: Katia: Sorry to “bother” you on your day off, Mino. Can’t figure out how to get into the store. Mrs. Chang is not on duty yet. Mino: No worries. Go to the white box on the wall next to the door. Open the cover and move the dial to this code: 6 9 1 0. A lock box will open. There’s a security card and key inside. Katia: Okay wait… Katia: Done. Mino: The card disables the alarm. Tap it against the black magnetic reader by the door. Katia: Uh oh. I put the key in first and now the alarm is going off! And I can hear a phone ringing inside. Mino: Don’t panic. Probably just the security people calling. Go in and answer the phone. Mino: What happened? Katia: Sorry, it was the security people on the line. I had to deal with them. Actually, Mrs. Chang ended up calling me too. I totally messed up. :( She was nice about it, though. She’s a cool boss. Anyway, thanks for your help.
